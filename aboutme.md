Hello there! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I'm fascinated by how software can solve real-world problems, and I am especially interested about data analysis and learning new technologies.

I have just finished a Visualization Study guide Project using Python and matplotlib. This project can serve as both a study reference toolkit and as a study guide for students who are new to Data Structures and Algorithms. I am now thinking of ideas of how I can keep improving my project in the future. I love the challenge of bringing an idea from concept to a working product.
